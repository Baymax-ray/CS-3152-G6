# CS-3152-G6

## EUDAEMON

WIP Game

CURRENT BUGS
- player can be caught in a jump in one direction unable to change direction
- player sometimes can't jump
- enemy sometimes launches player up in the air
- player can still gain spirit or be hit after the enemy is killed, probably because the markRemoved method only deletes the image, not the actual object.
