What is AIController doing:

1. How do we tell when we should turn back?
    1. All vertical collision with a wall, a bump, or the player should be handled by physical engine.
    2. To detect if we're reaching the edge of a platform, our current logic is that while initializing
        the AIController, we should know the current platform that the enemy we're controlling is standing
        on. Since our enemy can only move horizontally and the platform won't change (notice the precon-
        dition), we can handle this by simply comparing the position of the enemy to the edge of the platform.
